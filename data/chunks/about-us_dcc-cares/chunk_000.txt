About DCC Cares

DCC Cares is the flagship program launched by Dialysis Care Center. It serves as a trilogy of care: care for our patients, care for our employees, and care for the communities we serve. The program includes employee and patient recognition, team-building opportunities, celebrations, and regional events. Programs:

- DCC Ambassadors: Employee Recognition Award. A company-wide selection process nominates DCC Ambassadors to recognize outstanding contributions from our team members. - DCC Champions: Patient Recognition Award. This program celebrates patients who prioritize their dialysis treatments each month. - DCC Culture of Excellence: An initiative focused on delivering high-quality, patient-centered care. It emphasizes service excellence, enhanced customer service training, teamwork, and improving patients’ quality of life. Testimonials:
