Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) Overview

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a common home dialysis treatment option recommended by nephrologists worldwide as an initial and long-term therapy. PD is performed daily, either manually during the day or at night using a cycler machine. How PD Works:
When the kidneys cannot filter toxins and fluid buildup, dialysis treatment removes waste materials from the body. PD uses the abdomen lining to filter waste with a solution called dialysate. A surgically placed catheter allows dialysate to flow in and out of the abdomen. The catheter remains permanently in place, enabling individuals to continue daily activities such as work, recreation, showering, sexual activity, and exercise without interference. Transitioning from In-Center Dialysis to PD:
Patients starting with in-center dialysis may switch to at-home PD for greater freedom and flexibility. Support is available 24/7 from trained home dialysis clinical team members and vendor support for PD cyclers. Consult your nephrologist or care team to determine if PD is suitable for you.
