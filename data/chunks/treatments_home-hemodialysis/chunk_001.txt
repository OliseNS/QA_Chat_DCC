Patients usually have a care partner (trained caregiver) to assist with treatments. Care Partners:
Care partners help set up and clean the dialysis machine, monitor treatments, and provide support. They receive the same training as patients to ensure safety and effectiveness. Self-Cannulation:
Patients may learn to insert their own dialysis needles (self-cannulation) or have their care partner assist. Techniques like the buttonhole method make this process easier and more comfortable, allowing the use of blunt needles. Transitioning from In-Center Dialysis to HHD:
Many patients start with in-center dialysis and later switch to HHD for greater freedom and flexibility, while still having access to a dedicated clinical team for support.
