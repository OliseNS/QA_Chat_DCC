In-Center Hemodialysis

In-center hemodialysis is one of several available options for dialysis treatment. This modality involves receiving care from a specialized healthcare team at a dedicated dialysis center, typically during three sessions per week, each lasting approximately four hours. Many patients choose in-center hemodialysis for the following reasons:
- Dialysis treatments are supervised by trained kidney care professionals. - The center environment facilitates social interaction with other patients and staff. - The treatment schedule allows for four days each week without dialysis, providing flexibility. - After consultation with a nephrologist, many individuals find that in-center treatment aligns well with their lifestyle. How does in-center hemodialysis work? Upon arrival at the dialysis center, a multidisciplinary healthcare team—including nurses and facility administrators—manages all aspects of the treatment. A patient care technician (PCT) begins by cleaning the access area. The patient’s weight is recorded, and they are guided to their assigned dialysis chair. Prior to connecting the patient to the dialysis machine, both standing and sitting blood pressures are measured, and a dialysis nurse assesses vital signs. The dialysis session typically lasts about four hours, during which the care team continuously monitors the patient’s blood pressure and the dialysis machine’s performance.
