Mission & Values

In 2010, Dialysis Care Center opened its doors in Homer Glen, IL as Home Dialysis Services, offering a unique home dialysis experience focused on Care, Convenience & Freedom. In 2012, we expanded to provide In-Center dialysis, Peritoneal Dialysis, and Home Hemodialysis treatments. As a physician-owned and led company, Care is at the heart of everything we do. Our Mission

To provide the best quality dialysis services: that our patients and caregivers deserve, that providers choose for their patients, that our staff can be proud of, and that our partners prefer for long-term returns. We believe dialysis should fit into your life, not the other way around. We are dedicated to improving the lives of our patients by empowering our team, engaging with our communities, and driving continuous innovation. Our Core Values

- Exceptional Service: Commitment to excellence in patient services, always striving to exceed expectations. - Inclusivity: Fostering a diverse and respectful corporate culture. - Compassion: Providing compassionate care and support to patients and their families. - Integrity: Upholding the highest moral and ethical standards in all operations. - Teamwork: Working together as the “DCC Family” to achieve our shared mission.
