About Us:
Dialysis Care Center opened in 2010 in Homer Glen, IL as Home Dialysis Services, offering unique home dialysis experiences focused on care, convenience, and freedom. In 2012, we expanded to provide in-center dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and home hemodialysis treatments. As a physician-owned and led company, care is at the heart of everything we do.
