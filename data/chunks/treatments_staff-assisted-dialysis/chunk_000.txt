Staff-Assisted Hemodialysis

The Dialysis Care Center (DCC) Staff-Assisted Dialysis program is designed to prioritize patient needs by providing the option to receive dialysis treatment in the comfort of their homes, provided they meet specific eligibility requirements. The primary distinction between Staff-Assisted Home Hemodialysis (SAHHD) and Home Hemodialysis (HHD) is that SAHHD does not require the presence of a care partner, friend, or family member during treatment sessions. **What is Staff-Assisted Home Dialysis? **
Staff-Assisted Home Dialysis is a program that allows patients to receive dialysis treatment at home without the need for a care partner. This approach is particularly beneficial for individuals who prefer professional assistance during their treatments. **Who Performs Your Treatment? **
The key difference between staff-assisted dialysis and home dialysis lies in who administers the treatment. In staff-assisted home dialysis, a licensed nurse performs the treatment during each visit. Conversely, home dialysis requires patients to undergo training from a medical professional to learn how to administer the treatment independently. This training includes guidance on maintaining treatment records. After completing the training, patients are responsible for conducting their dialysis treatments independently. Staff-assisted home dialysis eliminates this responsibility, as a trained DCC professional handles all aspects of the treatment.
