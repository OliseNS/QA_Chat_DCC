Starting dialysis often leads to significant improvements in well-being, and adhering to your healthcare team's treatment plan is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Choosing a Dialysis Option

Selecting a dialysis option that aligns with your lifestyle can help you maintain your daily activities while managing your health. Common options include:

1. **In-Center Hemodialysis**: In-center hemodialysis involves visiting a dialysis center three times a week for 3 to 5 hours per session. A needle connects you to an artificial kidney (dialyzer) through your access site, and your healthcare team monitors the process. 2. **Home Hemodialysis**: Home hemodialysis allows you to schedule treatments at your convenience. A needle connects you to a dialyzer, and treating at home eliminates travel time and expenses. 3. **Peritoneal Dialysis**: Peritoneal dialysis uses the peritoneum (lining of the abdomen) to filter your blood without needles. This option offers flexibility, allowing treatments at home, work, or while traveling. Early initiation may help preserve remaining kidney function. Frequently Asked Questions
