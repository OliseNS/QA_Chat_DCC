Home Hemodialysis (HHD) is a type of dialysis treatment performed at home. It uses a dialysis machine to clean the blood by removing excess waste and fluids, then returns the cleaned blood to the body. HHD is similar to in-center hemodialysis but offers more flexibility and convenience.

Benefits of HHD:
- Dialyze in the comfort of your home.
- Flexible scheduling, including shorter daily treatments.
- Ability to maintain an active lifestyle (work, school, travel).
- More dietary freedom compared to in-center dialysis.
- Saves time by eliminating travel to a dialysis center.

Training for HHD:
After you and your doctor decide HHD is right for you, an HHD nurse will guide you through a personalized training program. Training covers:
- Using dialysis equipment
- Creating a hygienic environment
- Managing supplies
- Handling needles
- Keeping treatment logs

Most training sessions are held at dialysis centers. Patients usually have a care partner (trained caregiver) to assist with treatments.

Care Partners:
Care partners help set up and clean the dialysis machine, monitor treatments, and provide support. They receive the same training as patients to ensure safety and effectiveness.

Self-Cannulation:
Patients may learn to insert their own dialysis needles (self-cannulation) or have their care partner assist. Techniques like the buttonhole method make this process easier and more comfortable, allowing the use of blunt needles.

Transitioning from In-Center Dialysis to HHD:
Many patients start with in-center dialysis and later switch to HHD for greater freedom and flexibility, while still having access to a dedicated clinical team for support.
