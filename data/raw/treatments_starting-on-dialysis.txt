Starting on Dialysis

Understanding what to expect can help you feel more comfortable with your new treatment routine when preparing for dialysis. Before starting dialysis, your doctor will explain the available treatment options, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your lifestyle. Your care team will support you throughout the planning, training, and learning process, helping you adapt and thrive.

What is Dialysis?

Dialysis is typically initiated when kidney function drops to 15% or less or when severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle cramps, nausea, or vomiting occur. Dialysis helps remove excess fluid and waste from the body when the kidneys can no longer perform these functions. Your nephrologist will determine the appropriate time to begin dialysis based on your kidney function and symptoms. Preparation for dialysis is recommended during stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 30 mL/min. Starting dialysis often leads to significant improvements in well-being, and adhering to your healthcare team's treatment plan is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Choosing a Dialysis Option

Selecting a dialysis option that aligns with your lifestyle can help you maintain your daily activities while managing your health. Common options include:

1. **In-Center Hemodialysis**: In-center hemodialysis involves visiting a dialysis center three times a week for 3 to 5 hours per session. A needle connects you to an artificial kidney (dialyzer) through your access site, and your healthcare team monitors the process.

2. **Home Hemodialysis**: Home hemodialysis allows you to schedule treatments at your convenience. A needle connects you to a dialyzer, and treating at home eliminates travel time and expenses.

3. **Peritoneal Dialysis**: Peritoneal dialysis uses the peritoneum (lining of the abdomen) to filter your blood without needles. This option offers flexibility, allowing treatments at home, work, or while traveling. Early initiation may help preserve remaining kidney function.
