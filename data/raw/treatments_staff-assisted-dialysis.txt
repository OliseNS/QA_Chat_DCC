Staff-Assisted Hemodialysis

The Dialysis Care Center (DCC) Staff-Assisted Dialysis program is designed to prioritize patient needs by providing the option to receive dialysis treatment in the comfort of their homes, provided they meet specific eligibility requirements. The primary distinction between Staff-Assisted Home Hemodialysis (SAHHD) and Home Hemodialysis (HHD) is that SAHHD does not require the presence of a care partner, friend, or family member during treatment sessions.

**What is Staff-Assisted Home Dialysis?**
Staff-Assisted Home Dialysis is a program that allows patients to receive dialysis treatment at home without the need for a care partner. This approach is particularly beneficial for individuals who prefer professional assistance during their treatments.

**Who Performs Your Treatment?**
The key difference between staff-assisted dialysis and home dialysis lies in who administers the treatment. In staff-assisted home dialysis, a licensed nurse performs the treatment during each visit. Conversely, home dialysis requires patients to undergo training from a medical professional to learn how to administer the treatment independently. This training includes guidance on maintaining treatment records. After completing the training, patients are responsible for conducting their dialysis treatments independently. Staff-assisted home dialysis eliminates this responsibility, as a trained DCC professional handles all aspects of the treatment.

Benefits of Staff-Assisted Home Hemodialysis (SAHHD) include:
- Treatment conducted in the patientâ€™s home
- No need for a care partner
- Flexible scheduling
- One-on-one treatment with a trained professional
- Fewer dietary restrictions
- No travel required

**Who Supports You?**
In home dialysis, patients are responsible for managing their treatments and must select a care partner, typically a spouse, family member, or close friend, to provide support throughout the process. While having a care partner can be comforting, it may also lead to feelings of dependency or guilt. In contrast, staff-assisted home dialysis does not require a care partner. A licensed nurse administers the treatment and provides necessary support, ensuring patients are always under professional supervision. Family members can continue to offer emotional support without the burden of direct involvement in the treatment process.

**What Does Your Dialysis Schedule Look Like?**
A significant difference between home dialysis and staff-assisted home dialysis is the flexibility of the treatment schedule. Home dialysis may require patients to perform treatments even when they are unwell, increasing the risk of errors or adverse effects. Staff-assisted home dialysis alleviates this concern, as the licensed nurse manages the treatment process. This allows patients to undergo dialysis even when fatigued, ensuring a safer and more reliable experience.
