Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) Overview

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a common home dialysis treatment option recommended by nephrologists worldwide as an initial and long-term therapy. PD is performed daily, either manually during the day or at night using a cycler machine.

How PD Works:
When the kidneys cannot filter toxins and fluid buildup, dialysis treatment removes waste materials from the body. PD uses the abdomen lining to filter waste with a solution called dialysate. A surgically placed catheter allows dialysate to flow in and out of the abdomen. The catheter remains permanently in place, enabling individuals to continue daily activities such as work, recreation, showering, sexual activity, and exercise without interference.

Transitioning from In-Center Dialysis to PD:
Patients starting with in-center dialysis may switch to at-home PD for greater freedom and flexibility. Support is available 24/7 from trained home dialysis clinical team members and vendor support for PD cyclers. Consult your nephrologist or care team to determine if PD is suitable for you.

Common Questions About PD:
- **Infections:** PD infections can be treated at home with antibiotics. The risk of peritonitis is lower than the likelihood of receiving a kidney transplant in the U.S.
- **Time Commitment:** PD allows flexibility to spend time with family, work, or pursue hobbies.
- **Body Type:** PD may not be suitable for individuals who are overweight, muscular, or tall, but studies show similar outcomes for patients with raised body mass on PD and in-center hemodialysis (HD).
- **Disabilities:** PD can be performed with the help of a care partner or specialized equipment, with training programs available for safety and effectiveness.
- **Age:** PD has no age limitations and can be performed by older individuals or children with assistance.
- **Pets:** Pets must be kept out of the room during PD treatments, but maintaining cleanliness allows pet ownership.

Benefits of PD:
- Greater control over treatment and flexible scheduling.
- Self-administration of PD treatments.
- Overnight or daytime treatment options.
- Convenient home delivery of PD equipment.
- No needles required.
- Fewer trips to dialysis centers.
- Potentially fewer dietary restrictions.
- Improved sense of well-being and faster recovery between treatments.
