Before starting dialysis, your doctor will explain the available treatment options, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your lifestyle. Your care team will support you throughout the planning, training, and learning process, helping you adapt and thrive. What is Dialysis? Dialysis is typically initiated when kidney function drops to 15% or less or when severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle cramps, nausea, or vomiting occur. Dialysis helps remove excess fluid and waste from the body when the kidneys can no longer perform these functions. Your nephrologist will determine the appropriate time to begin dialysis based on your kidney function and symptoms. Preparation for dialysis is recommended during stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 30 mL/min. Starting dialysis often leads to significant improvements in well-being, and adhering to your healthcare team's treatment plan is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
