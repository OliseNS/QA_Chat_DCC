  "content": "Prior to connecting the patient to the dialysis machine, both standing and sitting blood pressures are measured, and a dialysis nurse assesses vital signs. The dialysis session typically lasts about four hours, during which the care team continuously monitors the patient’s blood pressure and the dialysis machine’s performance. After the session, the patient is disconnected from the machine, and vital signs are recorded again. How can patients spend their time during treatment? During dialysis sessions, patients may engage in various activities such as reading, watching television, working on a laptop, conversing with others, or resting. Dialysis centers often provide free Wi-Fi to support online activities, including streaming and communication. Who is responsible for patient care at the dialysis center? Patients entrust their well-being to a dedicated kidney healthcare team, whose support and expertise can significantly enhance the treatment experience. In-center hemodialysis offers comprehensive care from highly trained professionals committed to improving patients’ quality of life. Are there dialysis centers nearby?
