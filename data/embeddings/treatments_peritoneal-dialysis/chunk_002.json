Benefits of PD:\n- Greater control over treatment and flexible scheduling. - Self-administration of PD treatments. - Overnight or daytime treatment options. - Convenient home delivery of PD equipment. - No needles required. - Fewer trips to dialysis centers. - Potentially fewer dietary restrictions. - Improved sense of well-being and faster recovery between treatments.
