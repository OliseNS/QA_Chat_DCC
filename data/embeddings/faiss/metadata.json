Benefits of HHD:\n- Dialyze in the comfort of your home. - Flexible scheduling, including shorter daily treatments. - Ability to maintain an active lifestyle (work, school, travel). - More dietary freedom compared to in-center dialysis. - Saves time by eliminating travel to a dialysis center. Training for HHD:\nAfter you and your doctor decide HHD is right for you, an HHD nurse will guide you through a personalized training program. Training covers:\n- Using dialysis equipment\n- Creating a hygienic environment\n- Managing supplies\n- Handling needles\n- Keeping treatment logs\n\nMost training sessions are held at dialysis centers. Patients usually have a care partner (trained caregiver) to assist with treatments. Care Partners:\nCare partners help set up and clean the dialysis machine, monitor treatments, and provide support.

    "content": "In-Center Hemodialysis\n\nIn-center hemodialysis is one of several available options for dialysis treatment. This modality involves receiving care from a specialized healthcare team at a dedicated dialysis center, typically during three sessions per week, each lasting approximately four hours. Many patients choose in-center hemodialysis for the following reasons:\n- Dialysis treatments are supervised by trained kidney care professionals. - The center environment facilitates social interaction with other patients and staff. - The treatment schedule allows for four days each week without dialysis, providing flexibility. - After consultation with a nephrologist, many individuals find that in-center treatment aligns well with their lifestyle. How does in-center hemodialysis work? Upon arrival at the dialysis center, a multidisciplinary healthcare team—including nurses and facility administrators—manages all aspects of the treatment. A patient care technician (PCT) begins by cleaning the access area. The patient’s weight is recorded, and they are guided to their assigned dialysis chair. Prior to connecting the patient to the dialysis machine, both standing and sitting blood pressures are measured, and a dialysis nurse assesses vital signs. The dialysis session typically lasts about four hours, during which the care team continuously monitors the patient’s blood pressure and the dialysis machine’s performance."

During dialysis sessions, patients may engage in various activities such as reading, watching television, working on a laptop, conversing with others, or resting. Dialysis centers often provide free Wi-Fi to support online activities, including streaming and communication. Who is responsible for patient care at the dialysis center? Patients entrust their well-being to a dedicated kidney healthcare team, whose support and expertise can significantly enhance the treatment experience. In-center hemodialysis offers comprehensive care from highly trained professionals committed to improving patients’ quality of life. Are there dialysis centers nearby?

PD is performed daily, either manually during the day or at night using a cycler machine. How PD Works:\nWhen the kidneys cannot filter toxins and fluid buildup, dialysis treatment removes waste materials from the body. PD uses the abdomen lining to filter waste with a solution called dialysate. A surgically placed catheter allows dialysate to flow in and out of the abdomen. The catheter remains permanently in place, enabling individuals to continue daily activities such as work, recreation, showering, sexual activity, and exercise without interference. Transitioning from In-Center Dialysis to PD:\nPatients starting with in-center dialysis may switch to at-home PD for greater freedom and flexibility. Support is available 24/7 from trained home dialysis clinical team members and vendor support for PD cyclers. Consult your nephrologist or care team to determine if PD is suitable for you. Common Questions About PD:\n- **Infections:** PD infections can be treated at home with antibiotics."

This approach is particularly beneficial for individuals who prefer professional assistance during their treatments. **Who Performs Your Treatment? **\nThe key difference between staff-assisted dialysis and home dialysis lies in who administers the treatment. In staff-assisted home dialysis, a licensed nurse performs the treatment during each visit. Conversely, home dialysis requires patients to undergo training from a medical professional to learn how to administer the treatment independently. This training includes guidance on maintaining treatment records. After completing the training, patients are responsible for conducting their dialysis treatments independently. Staff-assisted home dialysis eliminates this responsibility, as a trained DCC professional handles all aspects of the treatment."

Staff-assisted home dialysis alleviates this concern, as the licensed nurse manages the treatment process. This allows patients to undergo dialysis even when fatigued, ensuring a safer and more reliable experience. The Dialysis Care Center is committed to providing high-quality home dialysis services that prioritize patient care, convenience, and freedom. For more information, call 844-466-3436."

    "content": "Starting on Dialysis\n\nUnderstanding what to expect can help you feel more comfortable with your new treatment routine when preparing for dialysis. Before starting dialysis, your doctor will explain the available treatment options, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your lifestyle. Your care team will support you throughout the planning, training, and learning process, helping you adapt and thrive. What is Dialysis? Dialysis is typically initiated when kidney function drops to 15% or less or when severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle cramps, nausea, or vomiting occur. Dialysis helps remove excess fluid and waste from the body when the kidneys can no longer perform these functions. Your nephrologist will determine the appropriate time to begin dialysis based on your kidney function and symptoms. Preparation for dialysis is recommended during stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 30 mL/min. Starting dialysis often leads to significant improvements in well-being, and adhering to your healthcare team's treatment plan is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Choosing a Dialysis Option\n\nSelecting a dialysis option that aligns with your lifestyle can help you maintain your daily activities while managing your health."

Choosing a Dialysis Option\n\nSelecting a dialysis option that aligns with your lifestyle can help you maintain your daily activities while managing your health. Common options include:\n\n1. **In-Center Hemodialysis**: In-center hemodialysis involves visiting a dialysis center three times a week for 3 to 5 hours per session. A needle connects you to an artificial kidney (dialyzer) through your access site, and your healthcare team monitors the process. 2. **Home Hemodialysis**: Home hemodialysis allows you to schedule treatments at your convenience. A needle connects you to a dialyzer, and treating at home eliminates travel time and expenses. 3. **Peritoneal Dialysis**: Peritoneal dialysis uses the peritoneum (lining of the abdomen) to filter your blood without needles. This option offers flexibility, allowing treatments at home, work, or while traveling. Early initiation may help preserve remaining kidney function. Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1. **Who pays for dialysis? ** Dialysis is typically covered by private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs. Contact your healthcare provider for assistance with coverage options. 2. **Do I need to control my diet on dialysis?"
