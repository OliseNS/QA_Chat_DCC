The program includes employee and patient recognition, team-building opportunities, celebrations, and regional events. Programs:\n\n- DCC Ambassadors: Employee Recognition Award. A company-wide selection process nominates DCC Ambassadors to recognize outstanding contributions from our team members. - DCC Champions: Patient Recognition Award. This program celebrates patients who prioritize their dialysis treatments each month. - DCC Culture of Excellence: An initiative focused on delivering high-quality, patient-centered care. It emphasizes service excellence, enhanced customer service training, teamwork, and improving patients’ quality of life. Testimonials:\n\n“One of the best things about working at DCC is working with people who are not just co-workers but are more like family. We all have the same goal—to take the best care of our patients, no matter what role we play.” — Angela P.\n\n“The most rewarding thing about working at DCC is knowing we are all a big family."
