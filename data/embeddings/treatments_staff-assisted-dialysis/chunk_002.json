  "content": "Family members can continue to offer emotional support without the burden of direct involvement in the treatment process. **What Does Your Dialysis Schedule Look Like? **\nA significant difference between home dialysis and staff-assisted home dialysis is the flexibility of the treatment schedule. Home dialysis may require patients to perform treatments even when they are unwell, increasing the risk of errors or adverse effects. Staff-assisted home dialysis alleviates this concern, as the licensed nurse manages the treatment process. This allows patients to undergo dialysis even when fatigued, ensuring a safer and more reliable experience. The Dialysis Care Center is committed to providing high-quality home dialysis services that prioritize patient care, convenience, and freedom. For more information, call 844-466-3436."
