  "content": "This training includes guidance on maintaining treatment records. After completing the training, patients are responsible for conducting their dialysis treatments independently. Staff-assisted home dialysis eliminates this responsibility, as a trained DCC professional handles all aspects of the treatment. Benefits of Staff-Assisted Home Hemodialysis (SAHHD) include:\n- Treatment conducted in the patientâ€™s home\n- No need for a care partner\n- Flexible scheduling\n- One-on-one treatment with a trained professional\n- Fewer dietary restrictions\n- No travel required\n\n**Who Supports You? **\nIn home dialysis, patients are responsible for managing their treatments and must select a care partner, typically a spouse, family member, or close friend, to provide support throughout the process. While having a care partner can be comforting, it may also lead to feelings of dependency or guilt. In contrast, staff-assisted home dialysis does not require a care partner. A licensed nurse administers the treatment and provides necessary support, ensuring patients are always under professional supervision. Family members can continue to offer emotional support without the burden of direct involvement in the treatment process. **What Does Your Dialysis Schedule Look Like? **\nA significant difference between home dialysis and staff-assisted home dialysis is the flexibility of the treatment schedule."
