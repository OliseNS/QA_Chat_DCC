  "content": "Home Hemodialysis (HHD) is a type of dialysis treatment performed at home. It uses a dialysis machine to clean the blood by removing excess waste and fluids, then returns the cleaned blood to the body. HHD is similar to in-center hemodialysis but offers more flexibility and convenience. Benefits of HHD:\n- Dialyze in the comfort of your home. - Flexible scheduling, including shorter daily treatments. - Ability to maintain an active lifestyle (work, school, travel). - More dietary freedom compared to in-center dialysis. - Saves time by eliminating travel to a dialysis center. Training for HHD:\nAfter you and your doctor decide HHD is right for you, an HHD nurse will guide you through a personalized training program. Training covers:\n- Using dialysis equipment\n- Creating a hygienic environment\n- Managing supplies\n- Handling needles\n- Keeping treatment logs\n\nMost training sessions are held at dialysis centers. Patients usually have a care partner (trained caregiver) to assist with treatments. Care Partners:\nCare partners help set up and clean the dialysis machine, monitor treatments, and provide support. They receive the same training as patients to ensure safety and effectiveness."
