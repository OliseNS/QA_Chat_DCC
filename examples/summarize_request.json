  "text": "Hemodialysis is a procedure where a machine filters waste products from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do so. During the procedure, blood travels through tubing into a dialyzer (artificial kidney), which removes waste products and extra fluid. The filtered blood then travels through another set of tubing back into your body. This procedure typically takes place at a dialysis center three times per week, with each session lasting about four hours. Home hemodialysis is also an option for some patients, allowing for more flexible scheduling and potentially better health outcomes."
